This is a way to represent and get the formula of electrical circuits.

It spans to constant expansion and is being built slowly but surely.

Here are things I'd like to implement that aren't really in the plan :
  - Calculating the circuit
  - variable resistances
  - Visual reprenstation of an AC signal changing (with calcultation)
  - Visual reading of circuits
